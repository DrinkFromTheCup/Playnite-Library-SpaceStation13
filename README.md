### Space Station 13 (and its BYOND launcher) library integration for Playnite

As of v0.0 (current release), the extension can:
- detect, add to your library and run BYOND (and SS13 through it) just fine
- direct you to needed install files if nothing were detected

Everything one might need to enjoy good old roleplay without necessity in fiddling with manual import.

### Caveat Emptor

Extension's codebase is, essentially, as robust as SS13's (of any variant).

Exercise discretion prior to installing.
