### Open for adoption!

Due to https://github.blog/2022-05-04-software-security-starts-with-the-developer-securing-developer-accounts-with-2fa/ , I can't continue my advancements at GitHub. Feel free to take over this repo, if you like.

### Space Station 13 (and its BYOND launcher) library integration for Playnite

As of v0.2 (current release), the extension can:
- detect, add to your library and run BYOND (and SS13 through it) just fine
- direct you to needed install files (and uninstall windows) if nothing were detected

Everything one might need to enjoy good old roleplay without necessity in fiddling with manual import (and/or remembering login credentials).

Attention to Portable BYOND install users:
- it is necessary to run BYOND at least once prior to using this plugin, to make sure that all relevant registry entries were created.
- as lack of compliance with this requirement will result in impossibility to connect to servers from web browsers (which one will need eventually anyway), it's the lesser evil.

#### Caveat Emptor

Extension's codebase is, essentially, as robust as SS13's (of any variant).

Exercise discretion prior to installing.
